## Introduction

Welcome to the repository of PATTY, a team participating in the World Robotics Olympiad (WRO) in the Future Engineers category. We are a group of university students who embarked on this exciting journey a few months ago, driven by a passion for robotics, innovation, and teamwork.

Here, you will find the design of our vehicle, the programming and component connection diagrams (including sensors, motors, and hub), the 3D model, various versions of the developed code, and other key resources that are integral to our creative and technical process.

Our primary goal is to qualify for the national competition, enjoy every step of the way, and create lasting memories together while learning and growing as future engineers.


## Content

Below, we present the information contained in each folder in our repository.

* `t-photos` contains 2 photos of the team.
* `v-photos` contains 6 photos of the vehicle, from every side.
* `video` here are the videos of the two rounds (the open challenge and the one with obstacles).
* `schemes` in here we have the several schematic diagrams in pictures of the electromechanical components illustrating all the elements used in the vehicle and how they connect to each other. And also, the schematic diagram of the programming of the open challenge round.
* `src` here is the code of control software for all components which were programmed to participate in the competition.
* `models` is where we have the 3D model of our self-driven vehicle.
* `other` is for other files which can be used to understand how to prepare the vehicle for the competition. It may include documentation how to connect to a SBC/SBM and upload files there, datasets, hardware specifications, communication protocols descriptions etc. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.


And here is also the images of the 3D model of our vehicle's model. However, you can download the model 3D in the models file, to have a better perspective of our vehicle.
