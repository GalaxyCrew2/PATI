## Introduction

Welcome to the repository of PATTY, a team participating in the World Robotics Olympiad (WRO) in the Future Engineers category. We are a group of university students who embarked on this exciting journey a few months ago, driven by a passion for robotics, innovation, and teamwork.

Here, you will find the design of our vehicle, the programming and component connection diagrams (including sensors, motors, and hub), the 3D model, various versions of the developed code, and other key resources that are integral to our creative and technical process.

Our primary goal is to qualify for the national competition, enjoy every step of the way, and create lasting memories together while learning and growing as future engineers.


## Content

Below, we present the information contained in each directory in our repository.

* `3D Model` here is where we have the 3D model of our self-driven vehicle, images, and other components.
  - `3D Model File` contains the file of the 3D model.
  - `Images` contains the images of the 3d model.
  - `Others` in here are the other components of the 3d model.
* `Code` here are the codes of control software for all components which were programmed to participate in the competition.
* `Project-log` contains the learning log, vehicle and team photos.
  - `Photos` it contains the 2 photos of the team, and the 6 photos of the vehicle, from every side.
* `other` contains the materials of our self-driven vehicle.
* `schemes` in here we have the several schematic diagrams in pictures of the electromechanical components illustrating all the elements used in the vehicle and how they connect to each other. And also, the schematic diagram of the codes.
  - `Electromechanical Diagram` in here are the electromechanical diagrams of the components used in the vehicle in the two different rounds.
  - `Flowchart`contains the flowcharts of the codes.
* `video` here are the videos of the two rounds (the open challenge and the one with obstacles).




##  Final thoughts

This repository gathers the effort, dedication, and learning we have accumulated as a team during our participation in the WRO, Future Engineers category.
Every part of the content—from programming and robot design to the logbook, connection diagrams, and materials—has been built with commitment and a lot of teamwork.

As first-year university students, facing this challenge has been an experience that pushed us out of our comfort zones but also motivated us to give our best in every stage of the project.

Thank you for taking the time to visit and explore our work.
We hope you find it useful, interesting, or at least that it reflects the effort we put into creating it.

With gratitude,

— Team PATTY
