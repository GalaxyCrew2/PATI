## Content

* `t-photos` contains 2 photos of the team (an official one and one funny photo with all team members)
* `v-photos` contains 6 photos of the vehicle (from every side, from top and bottom)
* `video` contains the video.md file with the link to a video where driving demonstration exists
* `schemes` contains one or several schematic diagrams in form of JPEG, PNG or PDF of the electromechanical components illustrating all the elements (electronic components and motors) used in the vehicle and how they connect to each other.
* `src` contains code of control software for all components which were programmed to participate in the competition
* `models` is for the files for models used by 3D printers, laser cutting machines and CNC machines to produce the vehicle elements. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.
* `other` is for other files which can be used to understand how to prepare the vehicle for the competition. It may include documentation how to connect to a SBC/SBM and upload files there, datasets, hardware specifications, communication protocols descriptions etc. If there is nothing to add to this location, the directory can be removed.

## Introduction






## Learnign Log

* `Date: Friday, April 4`
We began assembling the robot, deciding what its directional axis would be, its structure, and the position of its distance sensors.
We designed the robot's front with a somewhat geometric shape. We wanted to give it a new aesthetic and not have a traditional shape, or at least not so similar to last year's design.
We were unable to make progress with the programming; however, we already have the basics, and we just need to adjust certain things to adapt it to the new design.
* `Date: Friday, April 11`
We had to adjust the robot's front design, since its current shape made it difficult to place the front distance sensor. Therefore, we had to restructure the robot to make the electrical components (sensors, motors, hub) more stable.
* `Date: Friday, April 25`
The team eventually disbanded. The main reason was the difficulty two team members had adapting to the university. That's why they decided to drop out and focus on their studies, leaving one member.
However, there are two young people interested in participating, so the lack of members won't be a problem.
Today wasn't very fast-paced; we just met so one of the potential members could begin to understand the rules and methodology of the future engineers category.
* `Date: Friday, May 16`
Today the team was officially formed, and we decided by popular vote and with a little help from the club teachers, the team name "PATY" or "PATI" (which means the same thing, but this one is in English and the other in Spanish).
We began to organize the programming for the first round and upload the information we had prepared to GitHub, which were the photos of the robot.
* `Date: Friday, May 23`
We began by creating the 3D model of the robot in the Studio 2.0 application and decided to try a different programming format for the open challenge round. We didn't make much progress.
* `Date: Friday, May 30`
We couldn't meet because the school had an activity, so we couldn't work.
* `Date: Friday, June 6`
We didn't make much progress. Only one member was able to attend the school, and the track couldn't be set up to test the programming because it was too heavy for him to set up alone, and the manual workers were busy. But he improvised and created a small temporary track in the robotics room.
* `Date: Friday, June 13`
We made a little more progress than last week. The programming was tested again, but on the temporary track. We had to take photos of the robot again with a cell phone with a better camera because the previous ones were very blurry. We managed to upload the 3D model to the GitHub repository, which was difficult for us to figure out how to do, but our tutor helped us, and we were able to do it.
* `Date: Friday, June 20`
We didn't attend; we decided to focus on studying and completing each student's university assignments.
* `Date: Friday, June 27`
When we arrived, we saw that the robot had been in a minor accident and the rear wheels were disassembled. So, the first thing we did was reassemble it and check that there were no problems with the robot's Hub, sensors, and motors. Thanks to the 3D model with step-by-step assembly instructions, we were able to put it back together without any problems. We tested the obstacle course programming, but we still need to fine-tune it because, since the programming is adapted to the previous robot and not the current one, there are certain details that require us to adjust it.
* `Date: Friday, July 4`
Since we forgot to upload the new photos of the robot since we took them, we started uploading them and checking what we needed to upload to the repository. We haven't been able to test the robot on the track yet, but we've organized ourselves to upload what we needed to the GitHub repository.
* `Date: Friday, July 11`
We weren't able to do much today either. The graduating seniors had their soccer league kickoff, and we couldn't set up the track in the courtyard to test the robot. Since the track is so large, it doesn't fit in the robotics classroom because of the tables it has. However, we made progress with the programming flowchart for the open challenge round. We also managed to take team photos for the repository.
